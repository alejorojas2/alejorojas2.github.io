      <description>In the United States, soybeans are produced on 76 million acres of highly productive land, but can be severely impacted by diseases caused by oomycetes. Oomycetes are part of the microbial community that is associated with plant roots and the rhizosphere, which is a dynamic and complex environment subject to the interaction of different microbes and abiotic factors that could affect the outcome of the phytobiome interaction. Depending on environmental and edaphic conditions, some oomycete species will thrive causing root and seedling rot.</description>
